# Tempo

> “Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunderstorm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year. Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.” Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain, ch. 5, “Whims of Mercurius,” (1924), trans. by Helen T. Lowe-Porter (1928).

A Time library based upon conceptualizing time as intervals rather than instants.  A blog of the ideas behind this library is at [https://kipcole9.github.io/tempo/](https://kipcole9.github.io/tempo/).

There is nothing to see here yet, the current work is on implementing full suport for ISO8601 dates/times (both part 1 and part 2).
